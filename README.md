# Slider plugin

## Desctiption
Welcome on the slider plugin github page. This project is dedicated as portfolio background, so it's not ready for distribution (yet, maybe). But the slider plugin already has several advantages, that make it unique.
The main slider plugin advantage is a client-oriented approach. It has an API, that accepts variety of input data types (user decide what is convenient for him) and strict data types of output, which makes it predictable. And beyond that, application logic handles input contradictions and correct them (implicitly, for now).
The second excellence is a presence of architecture, precisely MVC. More on that below.
And also, there are tests.
More to come.
